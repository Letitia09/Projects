Instructions
Download and unarchive fs.zip
There are total of 200 files in 10 folders. Each file contains 50 numbers.
When a folder ends with an odd number, I want you to find files that end with an even number.
In those files, find all the numbers where either the 2nd or the last digit is 3. That is your output.
Print how many numbers are in your output
Make a new text file ('hw1_output.txt') with all of those numbers, one number per line.
